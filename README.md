🚧 AI Concept Chatbot — Documentation
1. 🎯 Project Overview
Description:
An interactive educational chatbot built with a no-code platform (e.g., Dialogflow, Voiceflow, or ChatGPT API via a GUI). It teaches AI fundamentals using natural conversational flows, multimedia, citations, follow-up support, and cross-linked learning paths. Deployable via public link.

3. 💬 Conversation Flows
Flow A: Learn about NLP
Welcome Intent: “Tell me about NLP” → definition of Natural Language Processing.

Applications Intent: “What can NLP do?” → List of uses: chatbots, translation, sentiment.

Challenge Intent: “What are NLP’s challenges?” → ambiguity, sarcasm, cultural nuance.

Ethics Intent: “Are there ethics in NLP?” → bias, privacy, manipulation.

Flow Depth: Each stage triggers follow-up intents (e.g., “How do we fix bias in NLP?”).

Flow B: Explore AI Ethics
Welcome Intent: “What is AI Ethics?” → Intro to ethics domains.

Bias Intent: “Explain bias in AI?” → Definition & examples.

Transparency Intent: “Why is explainability important?” → Make decisions understandable.

Accountability Intent: “Who is responsible for AI decisions?” → Legal and ethical frameworks.

Depth: Follow-up intents support ≥ 3 deeper questions each (e.g., “How to mitigate bias?”).

4. 🧠 Training Data Q/A Pairs (15+)
Your bot is trained on 15+ Q/A examples covering:

Core terminology (ML, NLP, LLMs, Neural Networks, Computer Vision)

AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

Real-world industry applications

Ethical principles (bias, transparency, privacy, accountability)

Each Q/A is tagged appropriately and mapped to relevant intents, including follow-through links (“You may also want to learn about…”).

5. ✨ Multimedia & Visual Design
Include engaging visuals such as:

Venn Diagram showing AI → ML → Deep Learning

Neural network schematic (input → hidden → output)

Ethics flowchart mapping bias → fairness → accountability

Screenshots embedded as Dialogflow cards or voiceflow blocks

6. ⚙️ Interactive & Follow-Up Design
Uses Contexts/states to track flow progression.

Supports at least 3 follow-up questions per topic.

Offers quick-replies like “Tell me more” or “Show me ethics.”

Includes Fallback Intent:

“I’m not sure I understand. Would you like to explore NLP, AI Ethics, or go deeper on a topic?”

7. 🔗 Further Learning Module Feature
After each topic, provides:

“🔍 Further learning: Check out Module 3 – Neural Networks & Deep Learning.”

“🔍 Recommended: Module 7 – AI Ethics & Fairness.”

Each recommendation includes citation to your bootcamp’s course content (module name, slide number, URL).

8. 🌐 Cross-Linking Concepts
The bot cross-references related topics:

When ‘Neural Networks’ are explained, it says: “This links closely to Deep Learning—want to dive deeper?”

When discussing ‘Bias’, suggests reviewing how bias occurs in Computer Vision and NLP.

9. 🧩 Edge Cases & Feedback
Handles edge-case inquiries like “What’s the difference between NLP and computer vision?”

Uses fallback to suggest possible conversational options.

Implements a Feedback Flow:

“Was this helpful? (Yes/No)”

If ‘No’ → “What could be improved?” (free-text)

Logs feedback for future iteration.
